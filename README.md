The Fornax is a small self contained desktop former that is portable and doesn't require any outside source of heat or vacuum.

I came up with the idea for this after using a toaster and a shop vac to create some styrene parts for a display. While I designed this model, I worked with a team to build it at my local makerspace, FamiLAB. It works great and we've already made use of it for some projects. This is not the final design, I had some aluminum extrusion left over from another project, so I decided to use that for the frame.  The next design will use strictly 2020 extrusion, and a different clamps for the frame as well as a easily adjustable lock for the rails.

The video of our build is here:
