          <p>I recently finished building a large vacuum forming table at FamiLAB for some other projects, but while building it I made notes for improvements as well as suggestions from friends.  The project is documented here <a href="https://familab.org/2016/08/familab-now-has-a-vacuum-forming-table/">https://familab.org/2016/08/familab-now-has-a-vacuum-forming-table/</a>.  It works great and we've already made use of it for some projects, but I wanted something portable as well.  I had some aluminum extrusion left over from another project, so I decided to use that for the frame. I also changed course this time to using a vacuum cleaner motor instead of a vacuum pump.  So far the results have been amazing.</p>
